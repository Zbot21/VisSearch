# VisSearch: A Visual Search Engine
Open-source GitHub version of my Senior Project @ IPFW (Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne)

This design is based on implementation utilized to publish [Exploring Web Based Interfaces for Searching Digital Libraries](http://cslab.valpo.edu/maics2016/paper20.pdf) in MAICS 2016 by Fowler, et. al.

This implementation is currently an incomplete version of that design.
